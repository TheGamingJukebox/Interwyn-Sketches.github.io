## Welcome to My Sketch Tests!

This is full of basically nothing and everything - tests, random bits of code I probably realized wouldn't work about two lines in, and other knick knacks. Enjoy if you want!









### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
[Classic FurrowBot] - [Soft Code Test Variables]:
void alignment()
{
    while(analog(5) < 20) {
        if(analog(1) < 20) {
         //routinethings
        } else {
          while(analog(1) > 20) {
            motor(3, 20); 
          }
          
        }
      }



}


```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TheGamingJukebox/user-name-cc.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
