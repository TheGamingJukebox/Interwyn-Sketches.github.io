## Welcome to My Sketch Tests!

This is full of basically nothing and everything - tests, random bits of code I probably realized wouldn't work about two lines in, and other knick knacks. Enjoy if you want!


```markdown
[Classic FurrowBot] - [Soft Code Test Variables]:

void alignment()
{
    if(analog(5) > 20) {
        while(analog(5) > 20) {
        motor(0, 20);
      }
     while(analog(5) < 20) {
        if(analog(1) < 20) {
         //routine
        } else {
          while(analog(1) > 20) {
            motor(3, 20); 
            }
        //routine
     }
  }
}

```
```markdown
[Classic FurrowBot] - [Things To Do]:

- More alignment, check soft code test variables and alter values for start with CBH

- Finish routine; Easy to do, but make sure plenty of alignments in there

- double check top hat bump detection; have Tijmen take off the bump sensor, comment out variable but keep everything just in case

- redo measurement for straight; has to be a few centimeter's farther because bot stops sooner than it did due to top hat detecting the bump sooner than the bump sensor did
